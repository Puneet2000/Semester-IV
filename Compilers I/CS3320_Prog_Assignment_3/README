Assumptions / Comments (if any):
1. Input given is correct and requires no semantic/logical check.
2. The black and white turns are seperated by only spaces not by any other whitespaces.
3. Last command in input file should follow by at most one new line.
	
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?

Approach :
1. Tokens/Regex are defined for PIECE (K,Q,R,B,N), COLUMN (a-h), ROW (1-8), MOVE (-), CAPTURE (x), PROMOTION (=).
2. Whitespaces and newlines are treated as tokens (SPACE, LINE) for meeting input specs.
3. ```turn``` is grammar variable which corresponds to differrent types of possible turns.
4. move piece, move pawn, capture pawn, capture piece and promote are possible turns.
5. each command looks like ```turn SPACE turn```.
6. each commmand is seperated by a newline character (LINE token).
7. 	```make_turn(**kwargs)``` plays a turn given the parameters.
8. Capture and move are similar in context of ```make_turn``` function.
9. Since input is logically correct, we just need initial and final cell of board in move and capture command.
10. promotion command is handled specially in ```make_turn```.
11. ```display()``` displays the board in specified format.
