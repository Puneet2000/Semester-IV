// define the "terminal symbol" token types I'm going to use, which
// are in CAPS only because it's a convention:
%token INT FLOAT STRING

// yacc fundamentally works by asking lex to get the next token, which it returns as
// an object of type "yystype".  But
// the next token could be of an arbitrary data type, so you can define a C union to
// hold each of the types of tokens that lex could return, and yacc will typedef
// "yystype" as the union instead of its default (int):
%union {
	int ival;
	float fval;
	char *sval;
}

// and then you just associate each of the defined token types with one of
// the union fields and we're happy:
%token <ival> INT
%token <fval> FLOAT
%token <sval> STRING

%%
// this is the actual grammar that yacc will parse, but for right now it's just
// something silly to echo to the screen what yacc gets from lex.  We'll
// make a real one shortly:
snazzle:
	INT snazzle { cout << "yacc found an int: " << $1 << endl; }
	| FLOAT snazzle { cout << "yacc found a float: " << $1 << endl; }
	| STRING snazzle { cout << "yacc found a string: " << $1 << endl; }
	| INT { cout << "yacc found an int: " << $1 << endl; }
	| FLOAT { cout << "yacc found a float: " << $1 << endl; }
	| STRING { cout << "yacc found a string: " << $1 << endl; }
